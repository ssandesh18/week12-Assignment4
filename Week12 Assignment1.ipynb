        "The t-test and Z-test are used to compare sample statistics to population parameters, but they differ in their underlying assumptions, applications, and the conditions under which they are most appropriate. Let us analyze and understand the differences between the two tests:\n",

        "Sample size considerations\n",
        "t-test: The t-test is typically used when the sample size is small, generally less than 30. It is designed to be robust when the sample size does not meet the threshold needed for applying the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
        "Z-test: The Z-test is used when the sample size is large, typically greater than 30. In large samples, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal, which justifies using the Z-test.\n",
        "Population variance knowledge\n",
        "t-test: The t-test is used when the population variance is unknown. Instead of the population variance, the sample variance is used to calculate the test statistic. The t-distribution, which has heavier tails than the normal distribution, accounts for the additional uncertainty due to estimating the population variance.\n",
        "Z-test: The Z-test requires that the population variance is known. This is a key assumption because it allows the use of the standard normal distribution to calculate the test statistic. When the population variance is known, the Z-test provides more precise estimates.\n",
        "Distribution assumptions\n",
        "t-test: The t-test assumes that the data within each group are approximately normally distributed. This is particularly important when dealing with small sample sizes. The test statistic in a t-test follows a t-distribution, which has wider tails than the normal distribution. This accounts for the additional variability and uncertainty when estimating the population standard deviation from a small sample.\n",
        "Z-test: The Z-test assumes that the data are normally distributed or that the sample size is large enough to apply for the Central Limit Theorem. The Central Limit Theorem ensures that, for large samples, the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal, even if the underlying data are not perfectly normal.\n",
